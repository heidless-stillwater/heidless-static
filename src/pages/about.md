I'm long term IT - BSc Comp Science - 1989. Started career with Sun Microsystems startup in UK - 1990. UNIX based Env (Solaris). Contracted in The City over the Millenium. Added career to the Arts - Actor, Writer, Producer, Director.

That period also involved delivering behavioural training in the Corporate Environment. Specifically, targetted at Team Mgmt & dealing with difficult conversations. Worked with numerous including BBC & International Banking UK, Europe, US & Asia.

Training strongly influenced by the Transactional Analysis Model. Simple yet Powerful.

Rode that horse until late noughties.

Returned to IT - initially as Dev then transitioned to Scrum Master with the Behavoural Training being particularly applicable.

Mid/Late teens began to experience the consequence of an undiagnosed life-long ailment. Spent a good while dealing with that.

Finally figured out the issue and finally effectively treated. Been left with some mobility issues but otherwise fit & able.

I've been updating my devops skills over the past 20 mths or so.

Initially tentative then with enthusiasm when I confirmed my skills we still very much applicable.

UNIX particularly gratifying ;-)

I've proven to myself that I am end to end capable. Inception -> Deploy.

Skillswise, I would say the crossbasr of my 'T' is in good shape while always benefitting from additional depth.

I am initially open to short term freelance/contract work with SMART delivarables.

This would give me an alpha test of my value and allow me to calibrate my Consultancy.
